# ECE-425---Wearable-Heart-Rate-Monitor
This project utilizes a pulse sensor connected to the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller to measure the user's heart rate. After measuring, the system displays the beats per minute on an LCD screen as well as the status of their heart rate depending on whether the user has a: high heart rate, normal heart rate, low heart rate, or no pulse at all.
