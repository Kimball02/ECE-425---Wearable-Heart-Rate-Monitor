# ECE 425 Wearable Heart Rate Monitor
This project utilizes a pulse sensor connected to the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller to measure the user's heart rate. After measuring, the system displays the beats per minute on an LCD screen as well as the status of their heart rate depending on whether the user has a: high heart rate, normal heart rate, low heart rate, or no pulse at all.

# Introduction
This is the final project for ECE 425 at California State University, Northridge (CSUN).

Completed by:
- David Kimball
- Kenneth Gayol

Professor
- Aaron Nanas

# Project Goals
- To design a user friendly wearable device that measures and displays the beats per minute of its wearer.
- To gain experience in using embedded systems fundamentals learned in class to design practical systems and devices.
